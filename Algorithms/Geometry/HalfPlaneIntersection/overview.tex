\begin{itemize}
  \item Input: A set of $n$ halfplanes, given by two points $a$ and $b$ on the boundary. The halfplane is to the left of the line connecting $a$ and $b$.
  \item Output: The intersection forms a convex polygon, whose vertices are returned.
  \item Complexity: $\mathcal{O}(n\log n)$.
  \item TODO: Implement a point struct pt.
