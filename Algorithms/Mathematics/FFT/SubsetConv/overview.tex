\begin{itemize}
	\item Applies known operations like $\log, \cdot, \cdots$ to the set power series $f(x) = \sum_{s\subseteq S}a_sx^s$ in $O(n^2 2^n)$.
  \item The code shows how to multiply two such series. For other operations you only have to replace the multiplication part with the naive computation of this operation.
