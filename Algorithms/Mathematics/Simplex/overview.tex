Solves a general linear maximization problem: maximize $c^T x$ subject to $Ax \le b$, $x \ge 0$.
Returns \lstinline{-inf} if there is no solution, \lstinline{inf} if there are arbitrarily good solutions, or the maximum value of $c^T x$ otherwise. The input vector is set to an optimal $x$ (or in the unbounded case, an arbitrary solution fulfilling the constraints). Numerical stability is not guaranteed. For better performance, define variables such that $x = 0$ is viable.

Usage:
\begin{lstlisting}
vvd A = {{1,-1}, {-1,1}, {-1,-2}};
vd b = {1,1,-4}, c = {-1,-1}, x;
T val = LPSolver(A, b, c).solve(x);
\end{lstlisting}
Time: $O(NM \cdot \#pivots)$, where a pivot may be e.g. an edge relaxation. $O(2^n)$ in the general case.
