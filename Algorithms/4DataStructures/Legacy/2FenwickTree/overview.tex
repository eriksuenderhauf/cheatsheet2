\begin{itemize}
	\item Input: $n$ elements with an associative operation which is reversible
	\item Preprocessing: $O(n\log{n})$ time and $O(n)$ space
	\item Requesting to change an element: $O(\log{n})$ time and $O(1)$ space
	\item Requesting the result of the operation on all elements in the range $[l,r]$: $O(\log{n})$ time and $O(1)$ space
	\item Output: the result of the operation on all elements in the range $[l,r]$
