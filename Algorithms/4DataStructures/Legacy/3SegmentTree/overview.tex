\begin{itemize}
	\item Input: $n$ elements with an associative operation (and other operations for ranges) (2D: $n^2$ elements)
	\item Preprocessing: $O(n)$ time and space (2D: $O(n^2)$ time and space)
	\item Requesting to change an element or interval: $O(\log{n})$ time and space (2D: $O(\log^2{n})$ time and $O(\log{n})$ space)
	\item Requesting the result of the operation on all elements in the range $[l,r]$: $O(\log{n})$ time and space (2D: $O(\log^2{n})$ time and $O(\log{n})$ space)
	\item Output: the result of the operation on all elements in the range $[l,r]$
