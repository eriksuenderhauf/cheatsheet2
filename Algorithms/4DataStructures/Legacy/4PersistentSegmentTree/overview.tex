\begin{itemize}
	\item Input: $n$ elements with an associative operation (and other operations for ranges)
	\item Preprocessing: $O(n)$ time and space
	\item Requesting to change an element or interval: $O(\log{n})$ time and space
	\item Requesting the result of the operation on all elements in the range $[l,r]$ for the version $v$ of the segment tree: $O(\log{n})$ time and space
	\item Output: the result of the operation on all elements in the range $[l,r]$ for the version $v$ of the segment tree
