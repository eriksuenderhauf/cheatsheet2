\begin{itemize}
	\item Input: graph with $v$ vertices, $e$ edges and no negative cycle
	\item Find a minimal-cost maximum flow: avg. $O(e^2)$ (worst case $O(2^v)$) time and $O(v+e)$ space
	\item Output: flow between \lstinline{s} and \lstinline{t} and its costs with values in \lstinline{e}
\end{itemize}
