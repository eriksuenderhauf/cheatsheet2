\begin{itemize}
	\item Input: graph with $v$ vertices and $e$ edges
	\item Find a minimal-cost maximum flow: $O(e^2\log{e}\log{c})$ ($c$ is the maximal capacity) time and $O(v+e)$ space
	\item Output: flow between \lstinline{s} and \lstinline{t} and its costs with values in \lstinline{e}
\end{itemize}
