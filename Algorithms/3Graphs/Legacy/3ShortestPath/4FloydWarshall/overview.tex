\begin{itemize}
	\item Input: graph with $v$ vertices and $e$ edges with weights
	\item Preprocessing: $O(v^3)$ time and $O(v^2)$ space
	\item Find the shortest path from vertex $i$ to vertex $j$: $O(1)$ time and space
	\item Output: the shortest path from vertex $i$ to vertex $j$ and its cost
\end{itemize}
