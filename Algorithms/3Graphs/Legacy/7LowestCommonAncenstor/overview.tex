\begin{itemize}
	\item Input: tree with $v$ vertices
	\item Preprocessing: $O(v\log{v})$ time and space for range maximum in section \ref{sec:RangeMaximum}
	\item Find the lowest common ancestor of two vertices: $O(1)$ time and space
	\item Output: the lowest common ancestor of the two vertices
\end{itemize}
